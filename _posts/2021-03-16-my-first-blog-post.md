<h2>New to GitHub</h2>
<p>I'm not going to edit much because I've learned that it's easy for me to mess something up by trying to get creative.
I'm making this post in the middle of March, in 2021. At this moment, I'm in in the final semester of my MA in Linguistics at University
of Iowa. Classes have been online for a long time, and I feel very disconnected from my courses and from the UIowa community. I hope that
as the days get longer, we will be able to see each other outside in person again soon. </p>
